**Statistical Models Repository**
Welcome to the Statistical Models Repository! This collection features a series of Python notebooks that demonstrate various statistical modeling techniques. Each notebook provides a comprehensive overview of a specific method, including theoretical background, practical implementation, and interpretation of results. The repository includes the following models:

**Linear Regression:** A fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This notebook covers simple and multiple linear regression.

**Ridge Regression:** An extension of linear regression that introduces a regularization parameter to address multicollinearity and overfitting. The notebook illustrates how ridge regression can improve model stability and prediction accuracy.

**Ridge Penalized Regression:** This notebook delves deeper into the application of ridge regression with different penalty parameters, showcasing how penalization can enhance model performance.

**Logistic Regression:** A powerful statistical technique for binary classification problems. This notebook explains logistic regression's principles and demonstrates its application in various scenarios.

Each notebook is designed to be educational and user-friendly, with clear explanations, well-commented code, and illustrative examples. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn statistical modeling or an experienced practitioner seeking to refine your skills, this repository has something for you.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and contribute to the repository. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!
